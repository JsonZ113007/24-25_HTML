            The classes are <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Scout">Scout</a>, <a

Each class has a purpose for the team.</h4>
        <h3><u>The following is a quick summary of the classes:</u></h3>
        <h4> <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Scout">Scout</a> is considered a flanker and focuses primarily on close range combat. His primary weapons can cause great damage at point-blank range </h4>
            <h4> <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Soldier">Soldier</a> is the "Jack of All Trades" class, being able to deliver loads of damage. <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Soldier">Soldier</a> is the in-between. </h4>
                <h4> <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Pyro">Pyro</a> can be a flanker, defense and a frontlines class. <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Pyro">Pyro</a>'s mostly known for his ability to locate enemy <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Spy">spies</a>. </h4>
                   <h4> <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Demoman">Demoman</a> is considered more of a defense class, capable of setting traps using sticky bombs. </h4>
                       <h4> <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Heavy">Heavy</a> is the most iconic class of <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/">Team Fortress 2.</a> <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Heavy">Heavy</a> is one of the best classes for delivering damage. </h4>
                           <h4> <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Engineer">Engineer</a> is the bulder of <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/">Team Fortress 2.</a> <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Engineer">Engineer</a> can support his team with dispensers and teleporters, all while having devastating firepower from his sentry. </h4>
                               <h4>  <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Medic">Medic</a>, the healer. <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Medic">Medic</a> is almost necessary for winning. One of his most notable features is his game changing ÃœberCharge, which can make a teammate invulnerable for 8 seconds. <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Medic">Medic</a> is a total game-changer. </h4>
                                   <h4> <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Sniper">Sniper</a> is the long range specialist. His sniper rifle is capable of taking out every class in the game. He is extremely useful for taking out important targets, a <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Medic">Medic</a> for example. </h4>
                                       <h4> <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Spy">Spy</a>, personally one of my favorite classes, is an assassin-like class. He's capable of disguising as enemy or friendly teammates, disabling/destroying <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Engineer">Engineer</a>'s buildings, and even capable of one-hitting an enemy by <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Backstab">backstabbing</a> them with his butterfly knife. </h4>
